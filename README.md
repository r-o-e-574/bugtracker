## Worked with Detrich, Matt, and Peter
Got help from Detrich on getting Ticket model setup

Peter helped clarify what as was needed for the assignment and explained to me how to optimize my index.html

Matt explained AbstractUser to me and how to get it to work without passing in new fields

Matt also helped me understand how to assign a user to a ticket while marking it as in progress, how to complete a ticket and how to make invalid
while changing the necessary fields .

In order to display ticket status I referenced this code
